# Image Steganography using OpenCV

## Problem Statement
This project aims to hide a secret message inside an image by modifying its pixel values. The goal is to provide a simple and secure way to encode and decode messages using image steganography, ensuring that the message remains hidden within the image pixels without significantly altering the visual appearance.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for implementation.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: Used for image processing and manipulation.
- **OS Module**: Handles file operations and system commands.

## Wow Factor
- **Simple Yet Secure**: Uses pixel-level manipulation to embed messages without affecting the visual integrity of the image.
- **Lightweight Encryption**: ASCII encoding ensures efficient and fast data storage.
- **Steganography-Based Approach**: Unlike traditional encryption, the message is hidden inside an image, making it less noticeable and easily shareable.

## End Users
- Individuals seeking a discreet way to communicate securely.
- Cybersecurity enthusiasts exploring steganography techniques.
- Researchers and students working on data-hiding mechanisms.

## Features
- Encode a secret message within an image.
- Secure decryption using a passcode.
- Prevents unauthorized access to the hidden message.
- Supports basic ASCII character encoding.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/Munaf-G/steganography.git>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install opencv-python
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python steganography.py
   ```

## Usage
1. **Encoding the Message:**
   - The script prompts the user to enter a secret message and a passcode.
   - The message is embedded within the pixel values of the selected image.
   - The modified image is saved as `encryptedImage.jpg`.

2. **Decoding the Message:**
   - The script asks for a passcode to retrieve the hidden message.
   - If the correct passcode is entered, the message is decrypted.
   - Unauthorized access attempts are denied.

## Example
```
Enter secret message: HelloWorld
Enter a passcode: 1234
Encrypted image saved as encryptedImage.jpg

Enter passcode for Decryption: 1234
Decryption message: HelloWorld
```

## Future Scope
- Implement stronger encryption algorithms to enhance security.
- Support for different image formats and color models.
- Develop a GUI-based application for better user experience.
- Use deep learning to detect and counteract steganographic attacks.

## Result
The program successfully encodes a message inside an image and retrieves it upon entering the correct password. Unauthorized attempts fail, ensuring message confidentiality.

## Conclusion
This project showcases a simple yet effective approach to image steganography. By encoding ASCII values within an imageâ€™s pixel data, users can securely hide and retrieve messages. The implementation demonstrates how images can act as carriers of confidential data.
